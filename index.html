      <h2>
        What should you bring?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Short answer: you don't <em>have to</em> bring anything. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you feel like contributing, the following can be useful: alcohol (gin, wine, beer), mixers (tonic, juice), fruit, nuts, chips, bread and p√•legg. 
      </p>
      <p class="dont">
        Just note that this is a veggie dinner, so only bring vegetarian or vegan food. No meat or fish, or anything like that. Also don't use eggs, onion or garlic, or let us know if it does have it, otherwise you will make your hosts sick.
